 @warning *Important:* You must also include the provided `SPLoginResources.bundle` bundle 
 as a resource in your application to use this class.
 
 If you want to save the user's details for automatic login, use the appropriate `SPSession`
 delegate method to receive login credentials for storage (don't store the user's raw password),
 then login directly next time using the saved credentias instead of using this view controller.
 If login fails, display the appropriate error and you can then show this view controller for logging in manually again if needed.
