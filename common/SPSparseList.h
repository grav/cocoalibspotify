 managing them in a list.

 The batch size parameter defines the minimum suggested number of
 items to request at a time from the data source. This is done to increase
 performance when a large number of small loading requests are made,
 such as from a table view data source. For best results, set the value to
 a number slightly larger than a "screenful" of data for your application. If 
 you're unsure, simply call `initWithDataSource:` instead and the class will
 choose a sensible default.
